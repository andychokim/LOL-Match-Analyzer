# LOL-Match-Analyzer
Personal project for an automatic League of Legends match analyzer.
This project takes in the user's Riot summoner name and tagline, shows the five most recent Summoner's Rift matches, and provides an LLM model's analysis of a chosen match.


This project utilizes React, Groq Library with the llama-3.1 LLM model, Jest, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas, Vercel, and AWS EC2.
