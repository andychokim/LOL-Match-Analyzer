This document explains this project's stack.

---

## Backend
**Stack:** `Node.js`, `Express`, `TypeScript`

- **Node.js:** It helps with a fast development by handling multiple different requests (for this project, for `Riot API` and `OpenAI API`) quickly with a Runtime environment based on event-loop and asynchronous I/O, and with its big community that can help finding solutions easier.
- **Express:** It offers a light framework with a huge ecosystem for a quick REST API development.
- **TypeScript:** Its static typing provides a better maintainability of the backend codebase.
